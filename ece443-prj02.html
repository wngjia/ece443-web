I. Overview</a>

<p>
Prof. Wang sent out an encrypted message to ECE 443/518 students.
Unfortunately he forgot the password as well as the original message.
Prof. Wang still remembers how he obtains the encrypted message:
first, a 256-bit key is generated as the SHA256 sum of a 4-digit password;
then, AES-GCM is used to encrypt and authenticate the message with the nonce
including all 0 bytes and the additional data being his email address.
</p>

<p>
For your conveniece, Prof. Wang has put what he remembers in a Go program
<a href="prj02-go.zip">here</a>.
Now it is your turn to find the password and the original message
using knowledge of cryptographic hash functions and ciphers.
</p>

II. Cryptographic Hash Functions and Ciphers</a>

<p>
Before you actually write code to find the password,
you will first need to understand how to compute SHA256 hash
and encrypt/decrypt with AES-GCM properly in Go.
You will need to read the two functions	validateSHA256()
and	validateAESGCM() and to observe their outputs in order
to understand how they work. Answer the following 4 questions
in your project report:
<ol>
<li>
From the output of validateSHA256(), decide the length of the hash
generated by SHA256. Is it as expected?
</li>
<li>
What is the length of the nonce used for AES-GCM?
What is the maximum message length implied
by this nonce length?
</li>
<li>
What is the length of the plaintext in validateAESGCM()?
</li>
<li>
What is the length of the byte slice returned by the Seal function?
How is this length related to the length of the plaintext?
Why is it named ciphermac?
</li>
</ol>

III. Find the Password</a>

<p>
Now you are ready to modify the function findPassword() to find the correct
password and then the original message. I have provided a loop to generate
all possible 4-digit password and you will need to add code to locate the
correct one via brute-force attack.
</p>

IV. Performance Evaluation</a>

<p>
Finding the correct password among 4-digit strings for Project 1 won't
require much computational power. However, if there are more choices,
we need to evaluate how many we can check within a reasonable amount
of time. Please evaluate the performance of SHA256
and AES-GCM using the following settings and estimae how much time
would it need to find a password among 8-digit strings on your computer.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Time the process to compute the SHA256 hash of a 16-byte message.
</li>
<li>
Time the process to encrypt a 1K-byte message (1024 bytes)
with AES-GCM using 256-bit AES key and no additional data.
</li>
<li>
Time the process to decrypt the message above
with AES-GCM using 256-bit AES key and no additional data.
</li>
<li>
How much time
would it need to find a password among 8-digit strings?
</li>
</ul>

Note that you will need to do your own research to find how to
measure time in Go, and you may need to run the experiment for
many times in order to obtain meaningful numbers.
